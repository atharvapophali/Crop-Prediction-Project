# Crop Prediction Project

## Overview

The Crop Prediction Project is a machine learning application designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders predict the most suitable crops to grow based on environmental and soil parameters. The project leverages data science techniques to improve agricultural productivity and support data-driven decision-making in farming.

## Features

- Predicts the most suitable crop for given soil and climate conditions.
- Utilizes machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- User-friendly interface for inputting parameters and viewing results.
- Provides information on crop requirements and suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, machine learning, and backend logic.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Streamlit / Flask**: (If applicable) For building the user interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and model development.

## Dataset

The project uses an open-source dataset containing soil and climate features such as:
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvapophali/Crop-Prediction-Project.git
   cd Crop-Prediction-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   - If using Streamlit:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - If using Flask:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

### Usage

1. Enter the required soil and environmental parameters through the provided interface or CLI.
2. Submit the form to receive a recommended crop prediction.
3. Review additional information about the recommended crop.
